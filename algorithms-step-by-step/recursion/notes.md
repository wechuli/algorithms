# Recursion

One way to describe repetition within a computer program is the use of loops.An entirely different way to achieve repetition is through a process know as recursion.

Recursion is a technique by shich a function makes one or more calls to itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of the very same type od tructure in its representation.

In computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for performing repetitive tasks. Recursion is an important technique in the study of data structures and algorithms,.
