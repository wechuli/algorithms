# Objects in Python
- Python is a dynamically typed language, as there is no advance declaration associatin an identifier with a particular data type
- When using a method of a class, it is important to understand its behaviour. Some methods return information about the state of an object, but do not change that state. These are known as accessors. Other methods, such as the sort method of the list class, do change the state of an object. These methods are known as mutators or update methods.

- A class is immutable if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instantiation that cannot subsequently be changed. Once as an instance has been created, its value cannot be changed although an identifier referencing that object can be reassigned to a different value

# Exception Handling
 - If uncaught, an exception causes the interpreter to stop executing the program and to report an approprate message to the console
