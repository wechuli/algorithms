## What is a Proof

A mathematical proof is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. The argument may use other previously established statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or original assumptions knows as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference.

## Proof by Example

## Impossibility Proof

- **Theorem** - A chess board 8 * 8 without two opposite corners cannot be tiled by 1 * 2 dominos
- **Proof**
    - black and white cells, 4 black/4 white
    - opposite corners are (say) black
    - 30 black and 32 white
    - a domino:two different colors
    - (at least) two white remain
    - quod erat demonstrandum

## Existence Proofs

### Proofs for Existential Statements
- **claim** - object with given properties exists
- **proof** - an example
- one example is enough
