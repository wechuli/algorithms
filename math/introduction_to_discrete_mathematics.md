## What is a Proof

A mathematical proof is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. The argument may use other previously established statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or original assumptions knows as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference.

## Proof by Example

## Impossibility Proof

- **Theorem** - A chess board 8 * 8 without two opposite corners cannot be tiled by 1 * 2 dominos
- **Proof**
    - black and white cells, 4 black/4 white
    - opposite corners are (say) black
    - 30 black and 32 white
    - a domino:two different colors
    - (at least) two white remain
    - quod erat demonstrandum

## Existence Proofs

### Proofs for Existential Statements
- **claim** - object with given properties exists
- **proof** - an example
- one example is enough

## How to Find an Example

How can we be certain that an object with certain requirements exist? One way to show this, is to go through all objects and check whether at least one of them meets the requirements. However, in many cases, the search space is enormous. A computer may help, but some reasoning that narrows the search space is important both for computer search and for "bare hands" work.
