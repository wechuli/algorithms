# Algorithm Basics

Algorithms are the recipes that make efficient programming possible. The explain how to sort records, search for items, calculate numeric values such as prime factors, find the shortest path betwwen two points in a street network, and determing the maximum flow of infromation possible through a communication network.

## Why Study Algorithms

- They provide useful tools that you can use to solve particular problems such as sorting or finding shortest paths.
- Algorithms teach you methods that you may be able to apply to other problems that have a similar structure
- Algorithms are like a workout for your brain. Studying algorithms can build your problem-solving abilities.
- Algorithms can be interesting, satisfying and sometimes surprising

## Approach

To get the most out of an algorithm, you must be able to do more than simply follow its steps. You need to understanf the following

- The algorithm's behavior
- The algorithm's speed
- The algorithm's memory requirements
- The main techniques the algorithm uses

## Algorithms and Data Structures

An algorithm is a recipe for performing a certain task. A data structure is a way of arranging data to make solving a particular problem easier. Algorithms are often closely tied to data structures.
